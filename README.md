TWITTER WATCHER - The app that lets you weed through current top trending tweets on Twitter without having to make a Twitter account. You do have to make a Twatcher account in order to be able to comment on a tweet but your sign-up info has nothing to do with Twitter. Enjoy!

# ICEBOX 
- AAU, I don't want the Trending page to always refresh with new trends unless I send the request for it.
